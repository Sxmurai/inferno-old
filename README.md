# Inferno

A 1.12.2 block game Anarchy Hacked Client.

So, I've stopped developing this because I got tired of 1.12.2, but soon I'll probably rewrite (again LOL) or archive this client and make a new one as I always have.

## Building

For the commands below: If you are on MacOS or Linux, add a `./` in front of the commands when running in a terminal.

1. Clone/download the code.
2. Run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` in a terminal.
3. Run `gradlew clean` in a terminal.
4. Run `gradlew build` in a terminal.

Once that is all done successfully, your JAR file will be under `build/libs/inferno-b1.1.0-release.jar`.

To clarify: the client is still in the development process and probably shouldn't be used in actual pvp justttt yet. By building this, you agree that you are downloading and using an unfinished project. You may report bugs. I highly advise against using the released JARs in the releases tab. They're all __**super**__ outdated.

## Upcoming Things

You can join the unmaintained and dead [Discord](https://discord.gg/2WFgNZtAUq), but your best bet is to check the projects tab. The most recently updated one is at [Project b1.1.0](https://github.com/Sxmurai/inferno/projects/1)

[Issues made by me](https://github.com/Sxmurai/inferno/issues/created_by/Sxmurai) can also give a good idea on what's coming up.
